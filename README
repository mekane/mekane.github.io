You can just commit Jekyll-formatted pages and push them to github. They will be run through Jekyll. 


## Install Local Jekyll

Install the Github Jekyll package to run it locally and match the github settings.

* Need Ruby
* Install bundler `sudo gem install bundler`
* Create a file in your site's repository called Gemfile and add the line gem 'github-pages'.
* After that, simply run the command, `bundle install` and you're good to go. 

## Run Local Jekyll

To run Jekyll in a way that matches the GitHub Pages build server, run Jekyll with Bundler. 

* Use the command `bundle exec jekyll serve` in the root of your repository
* Your site should be available at http://localhost:4000

To keep Jekyll up to date, run `bundle update`

## Writing Posts

To create a new post, all you need to do is create a new file in the _posts directory. How you name files in this folder is important. Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and MARKUP is the file extension representing the format used in the file. For example, the following are examples of valid post filenames:

`2011-12-31-new-years-eve-is-awesome.md`
`2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.textile`
