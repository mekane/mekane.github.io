You can just commit Jekyll-formatted pages and push them to github. They will be run through Jekyll. 

Install the Github Jekyll package to run it locally and match the github settings.

* Need Ruby
* Install bundler `sudo gem install bundler`
* Create a file in your site's repository called Gemfile and add the line gem 'github-pages'.
* After that, simply run the command, `bundle install` and you're good to go. 

To run Jekyll in a way that matches the GitHub Pages build server, run Jekyll with Bundler. 

* Use the command `bundle exec jekyll serve` in the root of your repository
* Your site should be available at http://localhost:4000

To keep Jekyll up to date, run `bundle update`
